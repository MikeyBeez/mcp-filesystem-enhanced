# Enhanced Filesystem Tool Status

## ✅ READY FOR ACTIVATION

The enhanced filesystem tool has been successfully built with bullshit detector integration.

### Features Added:
- **Smart Detection**: Identifies content that might benefit from bullshit detection
- **Trigger Words**: breakthrough, revolutionary, guaranteed, definitely, absolutely, best, perfect, amazing, incredible
- **Length Threshold**: Content over 200 characters gets a reminder
- **Gentle Reminder**: Shows helpful suggestion with exact command to run

### Test Results:
All test cases pass - the logic correctly identifies when to show reminders.

### Current Status:
- ✅ Code implemented in `/Users/bard/Code/mcp-filesystem-enhanced/src/index.ts`
- ✅ Successfully compiled to `/Users/bard/Code/mcp-filesystem-enhanced/dist/index.js`
- ✅ Logic tested and verified working
- ⏳ Waiting for MCP configuration to use enhanced tool instead of basic one

### When Active:
Writing content with marketing language or long content will show:
```
💡 Consider running the bullshit detector on this content to ensure clarity and credibility:
   bullshit-detector:detect_bullshit
```

The enhancement is ready to go! 🚀
